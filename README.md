# Poolr

A desktop workspace for systematic reviews and meta-analysis: define the question, find records, screen studies, extract data, assess bias, analyse results and prepare a manuscript.

**v0.6.4 release candidate** · [Installers and releases](https://github.com/harisawan-bit/poolr/releases) · [Build status](https://github.com/harisawan-bit/poolr/actions/workflows/build.yml) · [Release notes](docs/RELEASE_0.6.4.md)

## What changed

- A quieter review dashboard, collapsible navigation, readable analysis names, consistent profile avatars and logo, and improved light-theme controls.
- A learning workspace and protocol discovery links for PubMed, PROSPERO and Google Scholar. External search links are not evidence that a topic is novel.
- Native rclone storage with encrypted signing-key backups, owner-signed team membership, team switching and ended-team restrictions. No Poolr hosting service or cPanel database.
- Local revision queues, periodic Drive exchange and explicit resolution of concurrent versions. New remote versions refresh an open review when its draft is clean.
- Manuscript sections, contributor/reviewer assignments, deadlines, comments and saved checkpoints travel with the project.
- Preserved advanced-analysis data on project reopen, serialized local saves, zero-event input correction, independent full-text screening decisions and signed updater configuration.

## Start a review

Choose a profile and **New review**, select a review type, define PICO and choose data sources. **Learn meta-analysis** explains the workflow and links to methodological guidance. The BCG demo is an example dataset, not an editable production team.

Use **Project → Open / Save / Export** for local files. In the browser preview, working drafts are kept in browser storage; export JSON for a portable backup. Native file access and team signing are available only in the desktop app.

## Collaborate using your Drive

1. Configure a Google Drive remote with rclone. Rclone handles OAuth and token storage; Google authorization and an OAuth client may still be required. See [rclone's Drive guide](https://rclone.org/drive/).
2. Create a dedicated shared folder. Each collaborator connects their own configured remote to that same folder. Restrict actual Drive sharing to the intended collaborators.
3. Open **Teams & members**, create a signing identity and download its encrypted recovery backup. Keep the passphrase separately.
4. Create a team with a remote such as `research:Poolr/OurTeam`, then sync. The owner approves members' public-key requests and sends an invitation containing the owner's fingerprint and authority checkpoint.
5. Join, select the team and share a review. Periodic synchronization runs while the app is open, visible and online. Concurrent edits remain separate heads until someone reviews and publishes a resolution.

Owner: membership, assignments, end/reopen and content. Editor/reviewer: content and manuscript discussion. Viewer: read-only. Ending a team leaves only the owner able to publish. Editor and reviewer currently have the same content-write scope; section assignments coordinate work rather than grant isolated access to data.

**Security boundary:** signatures detect unauthorized permission changes; they do not prevent a Drive writer from deleting files or reading content outside Poolr. For confidentiality, configure an rclone crypt remote and distribute its key separately. Removing a member cannot erase their downloaded copies. There is no promise of uninterrupted connectivity, automatic conflict-free text merging, or audited security at thousands of simultaneous users. See [the full design and limits](docs/DRIVE_COLLABORATION.md).

## Local development

Requirements: Node 24+, .NET 8 SDK, Rust stable, and the platform prerequisites for [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/). Rclone must be installed for the real-transport integration test; packaged installers bundle it.

```sh
npm ci --prefix frontend
npm --prefix frontend run dev
# http://127.0.0.1:1420

dotnet test engine/Poolr.Engine.Tests/Poolr.Engine.Tests.csproj -c Release
npm --prefix frontend run test -- --run
npm --prefix frontend run lint
npm --prefix frontend run build

# Linux example; select your .NET RID on other platforms.
dotnet publish engine/Poolr.Engine.Api/Poolr.Engine.Api.csproj -c Release -r linux-x64 --self-contained true -o src-tauri/resources/engine
python3 scripts/bundle-rclone.py linux-x64 src-tauri/resources/engine
node frontend/node_modules/@tauri-apps/cli/tauri.js dev
```

The browser can use the loopback statistical engine, but cannot access signing identities, rclone credentials or arbitrary local files. Do not expose the engine port to a network. Build-time Python downloads/verifies rclone; the application runtime is React, Rust and C#.

## Packaging and updates

CI builds Windows x64/x86/ARM64, macOS Intel/Apple Silicon and Linux x64 installers into a **draft** release. Required checks run before packaging. Native platform signing/notarization is distinct from updater signing and requires the corresponding developer certificates.

v0.6.4 establishes a new updater trust key. If an old installation trusts a lost key, install v0.6.4 manually from a verified release; signature checking must not be bypassed. Private signing material is not committed to this repository.

## Screenshots

The release candidate browser preview, using the BCG demo:

[Light theme and collapsed navigation](docs/screenshots/v0.6.4/dashboard-light-collapsed.png) · [Learning workspace](docs/screenshots/v0.6.4/learn.png) · [Manuscript](docs/screenshots/v0.6.4/manuscript.png) · [Teams setup](docs/screenshots/v0.6.4/collaboration.png)

Team screenshots show the browser's native-access notice, not a simulated Drive connection. Images outside the v0.6.4 folder are historical.

## Research quality and license

Presets and statistical tools require methodological judgment. Tests cover specific numerical and workflow cases; they do not certify every analysis or make a review PRISMA-compliant automatically. Review the [Cochrane Handbook](https://www.cochrane.org/authors/handbooks-and-manuals/handbook/current/chapter-10) and the reporting guideline for your design.

This repository's [existing proprietary license](LICENSE) remains in force. Using open-source dependencies does not change Poolr's license or eliminate provider terms. Citation metadata is in [CITATION.cff](CITATION.cff).

## Product tour

Poolr keeps the review workflow in one desktop workspace. The left navigation can collapse to the pin mark; the full wordmark is used when expanded. Profile, avatar, active team, appearance, save state and connection status stay in the workspace chrome. The pin mark is used in collapsed navigation, browser tabs, app icons and installers. App icons use a larger centered pin on an opaque light tile for contrast at launcher sizes. Expanded navigation switches between dark-ink and white wordmarks to follow the selected theme; first launch follows the operating system, and the appearance control can override it. The wordmarks are [`poolr-logo.png`](frontend/public/poolr-brand.png) and [`poolr-logo-dark.png`](frontend/public/poolr-brand-dark.png); vector pin variants are [`poolr-mark.svg`](frontend/public/poolr-mark.svg) and [`poolr-mark-dark.svg`](frontend/public/poolr-mark-dark.svg); the generated app icon is [`poolr-app-icon.png`](src-tauri/icons/icon.png).

## Linux graphics compatibility

The Linux AppImage must exclude the incompatible bundled `libwayland-client` library. Older bundles can conflict with newer Mesa/WebKit and fail with `Could not create default EGL display: EGL_BAD_PARAMETER`. The release build pins Tauri CLI 2.12.1 or newer and checks the generated AppImage for those bundled libraries. Use the AppImage built from the current release branch; do not reuse older 0.6.4 AppImages.

## Release validation

Each release candidate runs the engine and frontend test suites, frontend production build and dependency scan, .NET formatting/security checks, Rust formatting/Clippy, and a six-target installer build. The Linux packaging check inspects the final AppImage. Full release acceptance also needs native install/update testing on each supported OS and architecture, cross-account Drive permission tests, and independent statistical/security review. See [release validation](docs/RELEASE_0.6.4.md) for exact results and known limits.
