## [0.6.3] - 2026-09-18

### Added
- **Google OAuth & Identity Resolution**: Prominent Google Sign-in across UI header, onboarding screen, and profile dropdown. Real token exchange via Google Identity Services (GIS) and Bearer auth against `/oauth2/v3/userinfo` for robust avatar and profile synchronization.
- **Organized Google Drive BYOS (Bring-Your-Own-Storage)**: Clean folder hierarchy (`My Drive/Poolr Workspace/Projects/{Title}_{UUID}/`), RFC 2387 multipart MIME uploads for create/update without payload truncation, and automated subfile sync (`changelog.json`, `permissions.json`, `comments.json`, `authorship.json`, `manuscript.json`).
- **Team Sharing & Collaboration**: Direct Google Drive Permissions API integration to share reviews with collaborators (`writer`, `commenter`, `reader`), plus shared review discovery (`sharedWithMe`).
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 4-tier team governance (`Owner`, `Lead Methodologist / Editor`, `Reviewer`, `Auditor / Viewer`) enforcing access boundaries across Protocol, Screening, Extraction, Risk of Bias, Meta-Analysis, and Export.
- **Concurrent Edit Protection & Audit Trail**: Real-time section soft locks preventing simultaneous overwrite collisions, append-only delta change logging (`ChangeDelta`) for PRISMA 2020 / Cochrane compliance, and an interactive 3-way visual conflict resolution modal (`ConflictResolverModal`).
- **Step-Level Commenting Drawer**: Reusable inline discussion drawer (`StepCommentsDrawer` / `StepCommentsButton`) mounted on all review step headers (Protocol, Screening, Extraction, Risk of Bias, Meta-Analysis, Manuscript).
- **ICMJE & CRediT Authorship Tracking**: Automatic active-time monitoring per contributor and review section, providing an audit-grade authorship table exportable to Markdown.
- **Collaborative Manuscript Studio**: Dedicated manuscript workstation (`ManuscriptHelper`) with live Markdown editing, formatting toolbar, data/citation insertion from review phases, contributor assignment, and multi-format exports (.md, .doc, PDF).

### Fixed
- **Windows WebView2 Transparent Window Bug**: Resolved white screen / flicker on startup by disabling window transparency in `tauri.conf.json` and declaring solid fallback background color on `html`, `body`, and `#root`.
- **Google OAuth Token Decoding**: Fixed invalid JWT decoding attempts on opaque Google access tokens (`ya29...`) by querying Google's userinfo endpoint.
- **Drive Update Data Loss**: Fixed upload bug in `drive-sync.ts` where updating existing files sent only metadata and dropped file content.
- **In-App Navigation & Project Loading**: Connected dead DOM event bus (`poolr:gopage` and `poolr:loadProject`) in `App.tsx` for seamless routing without page reloads.

### Legal & Commercial
- **Proprietary License Update**: Closed-source proprietary EULA for `Muhammad Haris Awan (d/b/a The Method Lab)` featuring corporate successor assignment, unilateral rights to introduce paid subscription plans/paywalls without grandfathering, BYOS storage disclaimers, and medical evidence synthesis disclaimers.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-09-17

## [0.6.1] - 2026-09-15

### Added
- **Multi-Study Support**: Added `StudyManager` with localStorage persistence and interactive `StudySelector` to effortlessly switch between active systematic reviews.
- **AnalysisHub (34+ Specialized Engines)**: Tabbed workspace integrating Bayesian MCMC, GOSH diagnostics, Permutation tests, Bootstrap CIs, Test of Excess Significance (TES), RevMan 5 bidirectional import/export, and reference manager sync (Zotero/Mendeley).
- **Quality Assessment Workflows**: Added dedicated interfaces and backend engines for RoB 2, ROBINS-I, QUADAS-2, AMSTAR-2, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), and GRADE Evidence Profiles.
- **Statistical Parity Suite**: Expanded xUnit regression benchmark tests to 226 tests covering all new engines with zero failures.

### Fixed
- Code formatting across .NET engines enforcing zero-warning standards.
- Clean TypeScript and React 19 build across all analysis pages and components.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed
- **Import parsers (critical)**: MEDLINE/RIS/EndNote parsers now split on 2+ consecutive newlines instead of whitespace lines
- **PubMed search**: Replaced inline efetch parser with shared `parseMedline`
- **Blocking dialogs eliminated**: All `alert()`/`confirm()`/`prompt()` calls replaced with inline banners
- **React stability**: Fixed stale closure in Meta.tsx auto-run; stabilized render-unstable arrays via `useRef`
- **Grey Literature**: Replaced mock data with real Google Scholar/ClinicalTrials.gov/OpenAlex API calls
